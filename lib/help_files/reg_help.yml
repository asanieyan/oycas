    sdescription: The first step in joining Oycas is registering. You can register by clicking the "register" link on the login page. This
      takes you to another page where you will enter a valid school email address from a supported school (you can see a list of supported
      schools by clicking the link to the right of this box), your full name, a desired password, and your school status. When you submit 
      this information, a validation email will be sent to you. By clicking on the link in the email, your account will be activated.

        question: I am a Staff/Faculty member and I tried registering, but I can't. Why?
        answer: Currently Staff and Faculty members are not supported by our system. We are currently working
          on giving you your own functionality.

        question: I have forgotten my password. How do I find out what it is?
        answer: Oycas does not provide a facility to find out what your forgotten password was for security reasons. You can, however
          click on the "forgot your password?" link, and you will be taken to a page where you can enter the email address and an email
          will be sent to you that allows you to reset your password.
