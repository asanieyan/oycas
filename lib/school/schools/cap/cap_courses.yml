In addressing the second question, the course focuses on the conflict between faith and reason. Topics include the ethics of believing without evidence, arguments for and against objective reasoning, and the pragmatic justification of religious belief. The course is relevant to all students, from any tradition, with or without religious faith. The only prerequisite is an interest in exploring metaphysical and epistemological arguments in answer to the above central questions of philosophical inquiry.

What is the nature of mental states? What is the relationship between the mind and the body? Will a physical explanation of consciousness explain consciousness? Are 'zombies' possible?

Are we purely egocentric beings-biological machines of some sort - or are we spiritual, immaterial beings? Is there some enduring entity that defines the self? Are we free to do as we choose? Or are we essentially passionate creatures who act strictly on the basis of our feelings? Ultimately, our goal will be to learn to think critically and independently about these issues."
