As interest in women and technological change has grown in the past 25 years, the benefits of focusing on gender as a variable of study have extended beyond making women's experiences visible. Focusing on gender offers the possibility of discovering theoretical limitations which, when addressed, have implications that extend beyond the interests of women.

    :subject: IART
    :description: After first establishing the context of post-industrial knowledge society, students analyze the contexts within which communication, interaction and reception occur and view all production as cultural.

What is emerging as cultural phenomena in the real world in unexpected places provide starting places for studying &quot;&quot;the space of flows&quot;&quot;, what happens between point A and point B. We look here to find the shifts that indicate how technology is regionalized and localized and how human experience is experienced.

    :description: "Discrete mathematics is used in computer communications, scheduling and transportation problems. Statistics is encountered by each of us every day in the newspapers and on television as medical findings, sporting results and economic strategies are discussed. These are two of the most accessible areas of modern applied mathematics and many problems and the ideas behind their solution can be understood and appreciated by students with only a modest mathematical background. Several topics in these areas and their relationship to real world problems will be explored. The exploration will be done through a series of projects with students often working in teams and making presentations of their discoveries. The presentation will be non-theoretical.
