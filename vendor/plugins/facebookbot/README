== Hello from FacebookBot!

FacebookBot is a blast from the future! Basically, it can (will? might?) turn the
beloved Facebook into some sort of monster. It allows for completely 
automated control of your Facebook profile. Now with less MySpace!

FacebookBot allows you to destroy Facebook via:

* Posting Profile Pictures
* Tagging Pictures
* Changing your Status
* Posting Wall Comments
* Changing Personal Profile Information
* A system for generating random sentences (rather simply)
* And much more...

== Downloading

You can obtain the hot-off-the-press-brand-spanking-new FacebookBot and
loads of pretty examples from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3643 !

== License

FacebookBot is provided to you kindly under the MIT license.
A copy of the MIT license can be found in the LICENSE file.

== Setup

FacebookBot is just a simple Ruby program. So, obviously you'll need
ruby installed. It would probably be a good idea if you actually
knew ruby too. However, there is at least one module you
should probably install, if you want the program to work.

Here's a list:

* Hpricot (see http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/)

Wasn't that a short list? The following should already be installed,
but are also used rigorously:

* Net::HTTP
* Net::HTTPS
* CGI
* OptParse
* URI

To install these, you can try `gem install gemnamehere` -- worked for me!

== Usage

Please use FacebookBot for good, not evil. We don't want another
Myspace on our hands. Look at the EXAMPLES file for examples.

== Support

You can try emailing me. Or maybe ask a kind neighbor?
A friend from the past? An ex-lover? You can also check out
the FacebookBot Rubyforge page, located at 
http://rubyforge.org/projects/facebookbot/

Enjoy, and don't forget your smile!
