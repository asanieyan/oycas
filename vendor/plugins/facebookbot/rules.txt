QUOTE-->Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly. ~ Albert Einstein
QUOTE-->Grown-ups never understand anything for themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
QUOTE-->Hatred, as well as love, renders its votaries credulous. ~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau
QUOTE-->The highest result of education is tolerance. Long ago men fought and died for their faith; but it took ages to teach them the other kind of courage, — the courage to recognize the faiths of their brethren and their rights of conscience. Tolerance is the first principal of community; it is the spirit which conserves the best that all men think. ~ Helen Keller
QUOTE-->For the future, let all people live in harmony ... Men should be taught and won over by reason, not by blows, insults, and corporal punishments. ~ Julian
QUOTE-->The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. ~ George Orwell
QUOTE-->There is nothing better or more necessary than love. ~ John of the Cross
QUOTE-->We thought: we're poor, we have nothing, but when we started losing one after the other so each day became remembrance day, we started composing poems about God's great generosity and — our former riches. ~ Anna Akhmatova
QUOTE-->The intellectual is constantly betrayed by his vanity. Godlike he blandly assumes that he can express everything in words; whereas the things one loves, lives, and dies for are not, in the last analysis completely expressible in words. ~ Anne Morrow Lindbergh
QUOTE-->Liberty, as it is conceived by current opinion, has nothing inherent about it; it is a sort of gift or trust bestowed on the individual by the state pending good behavior. ~ Mary McCarthy
QUOTE-->We wanted to bring some love to the world. I thought we were good at doing that. Bringin' love to the world. ~ Brian Wilson
QUOTE-->It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it. ~ Aung San Suu Kyi
QUOTE-->It is confidently expected that the period is at hand, when man, through ignorance, shall not much longer inflict unnecessary misery on man; because the mass of mankind will become enlightened, and will clearly discern that by so acting they will inevitably create misery to themselves. ~ Robert Owen
QUOTE-->'Fire' does not matter, 'earth' and 'air' and 'water' do not matter. 'I' do not matter. No word matters. But man forgets reality and remembers words. ~ Roger Zelazny in Lord of Light
QUOTE-->Duty, Honor, Country — those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn. ~ Douglas MacArthur
QUOTE-->Positive vibrations man. That's what makes it work. That's reggae music. You can't look away because it's real. You listen to what I sing because I mean what I sing, there's no secret, no big deal. Just honesty, that's all. ~ Bob Marley
QUOTE-->The Truth lies not in the Yes and not in the No, but in the knowledge and the beginning from which the Yes and the No arise. ~ Karl Barth
QUOTE-->The time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come. The time to build is upon us. ~ Nelson Mandela
QUOTE-->While in the physical sciences the investigator will be able to measure what, on the basis of a prima facie theory, he thinks important, in the social sciences often that is treated as important which happens to be accessible to measurement. This is sometimes carried to the point where it is demanded that our theories must be formulated in such terms that they refer only to measurable magnitudes. ~ Friedrich Hayek
QUOTE-->The meaning of the living words that come out of the experiences of great hearts can never be exhausted by any one system of logical interpretation. They have to be endlessly explained by the commentaries of individual lives, and they gain an added mystery in each new revelation. ~ Rabindranath Tagore
QUOTE-->Thinking is an experimental dealing with small quantities of energy, just as a general moves miniature figures over a map before setting his troops in action. ~ Sigmund Freud
QUOTE-->Once you label me you negate me. ~ Søren Kierkegaard
QUOTE-->Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing. I have only begun to learn content and peace of mind since I have resolved at all risks to do this. ~ T. H. Huxley
QUOTE-->Education is what you get when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. ~ Pete Seeger
QUOTE-->We are near waking when we dream that we dream. ~ Novalis
QUOTE-->I react pragmatically. Where the market works, I'm for that. Where the government is necessary, I'm for that. I'm deeply suspicious of somebody who says, 'I'm in favor of privatization,' or, 'I'm deeply in favor of public ownership.' I'm in favor of whatever works in the particular case. ~ John Kenneth Galbraith
QUOTE-->The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. ~ Yeshua (Jesus Christ)
QUOTE-->Although to penetrate into the intimate mysteries of nature and thence to learn the true causes of phenomena is not allowed to us, nevertheless it can happen that a certain fictive hypothesis may suffice for explaining many phenomena. ~ Leonhard Euler
QUOTE-->Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. ~ Yeshua (Jesus Christ)
QUOTE-->I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it. ~ Thomas Jefferson
QUOTE-->Man is a creature of hope and invention, both of which belie the idea that things cannot be changed. ~ Tom Clancy
QUOTE-->A writer writes not because he is educated but because he is driven by the need to communicate. Behind the need to communicate is the need to share. Behind the need to share is the need to be understood. The writer wants to be understood much more than he wants to be respected or praised or even loved. And that perhaps, is what makes him different from others. ~ Leo Rosten
QUOTE-->Any relations in a social order will endure if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy, which qualifies life for immortality. ~ George William Russell
QUOTE-->I'm sure we all agree that we ought to love one another, and I know there are people in the world who do not love their fellow human beings — and I hate people like that! ~ Tom Lehrer
QUOTE-->Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love. This is the eternal rule. ~ Gautama Buddha
QUOTE-->The very essence of a free government consists in considering offices as public trusts, bestowed for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of an individual or a party. ~ John C. Calhoun
QUOTE-->Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof. ~ "V" in V for Vendetta
QUOTE-->Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor. He talks as the man of his age talks, that is, with rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness. ~ Raymond Chandler
QUOTE-->Fortune, which has a great deal of power in other matters but especially in war, can bring about great changes in a situation through very slight forces. ~ Julius Caesar
QUOTE-->Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution. ~ Albert Einstein
QUOTE-->Don't play for safety. It's the most dangerous thing in the world. ~ Hugh Walpole
QUOTE-->Good writers define reality; bad ones merely restate it. A good writer turns fact into truth; a bad writer will, more often than not, accomplish the opposite. ~ Edward Albee
QUOTE-->Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable, let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all. ~ Douglas Adams
QUOTE-->All that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome. ~ Kate Sheppard
QUOTE-->Some choices will choose you. How you face these choices, these turns in the road, with what kind of attitude, more than the choices themselves, is what will define the context of your life. ~ Dana Reeve
QUOTE-->The character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. ~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
QUOTE-->Sure, ninety percent of science fiction is crud. That's because ninety percent of everything is crud. ~ Theodore Sturgeon
QUOTE-->That so many writers have been prepared to accept a kind of martyrdom is the best tribute that flesh can pay to the living spirit of man as expressed in his literature. One cannot doubt that the martyrdom will continue to be gladly embraced. To some of us, the wresting of beauty out of language is the only thing in the world that matters. ~ Anthony Burgess
QUOTE-->Our armament must be adequate to the needs, but our faith is not primarily in these machines of defense but in ourselves. ~ Chester Nimitz
QUOTE-->Man is always something more than what he knows of himself. He is not what he is simply once and for all, but is a process... ~ Karl Jaspers
QUOTE-->I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. ~ George Washington
QUOTE-->When others asked the truth of me, I was convinced it was not the truth they wanted, but an illusion they could bear to live with. ~ Anaïs Nin
QUOTE-->We picked up everything we could get our hands on. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug-collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
  The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. ~ Hunter S. Thompson
QUOTE-->External success has to do with people who may see me as a model, or an example, or a representative. As much as I may dislike or want to reject that responsibility, this is something that comes with public success. It's important to give others a sense of hope that it is possible and you can come from really different places in the world and find your own place in the world that's unique for yourself. ~ Amy Tan
QUOTE-->At some point in life the world's beauty becomes enough. You don't need to photograph, paint or even remember it. It is enough. No record of it needs to be kept and you don't need someone to share it with or tell it to. When that happens — that letting go — you let go because you can. ~ Toni Morrison
QUOTE-->Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. ~ Michael Jordan
QUOTE-->Politics, as a practice, whatever its professions, has always been the systematic organization of hatreds. ~ Henry Adams
QUOTE-->I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forego their use. ~ Galileo Galilei
QUOTE-->Some things you don't need until they leave you; they're the things that you miss. ~ Rob Thomas
QUOTE-->Life is what it is, and you take what's handed, and you work as hard as you can, and hopefully you'll be successful, but I just don't spend too much time worrying about that. ~ Jerry Springer
QUOTE-->Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it. ~ Abraham Lincoln
QUOTE-->When writing about transcendental issues, be transcendentally clear. ~ René Descartes
QUOTE-->What for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel but the irresistible power of unarmed truth. ~ Boris Pasternak
QUOTE-->Does it really matter what these affectionate people do — so long as they don’t do it in the streets and frighten the horses? ~ Mrs Patrick Campbell
QUOTE-->There are, indeed, two forms of discontent: one laborious, the other indolent and complaining. We respect the man of laborious desire, but let us not suppose that his restlessness is peace, or his ambition meekness. It is because of the special connection of meekness with contentment that it is promised that the meek shall 'inherit the earth.' Neither covetous men, nor the grave, can inherit anything; they can but consume. Only contentment can possess. ~ John Ruskin
QUOTE-->He judged it not fit to determine anything rashly; and seemed to doubt whether those different forms of religion might not all come from God, who might inspire man in a different manner, and be pleased with this variety; he therefore thought it indecent and foolish for any man to threaten and terrify another to make him believe what did not appear to him to be true. ~ Thomas More
QUOTE-->You and I are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or right, but I would like to suggest that there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down — up to a man's age-old dream; the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order — or down to the ant heap totalitarianism, and regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course. ~ Ronald Reagan
QUOTE-->What counts now is not just what we are against, but what we are for. Who leads us is less important than what leads us—what convictions, what courage, what faith—win or lose. ~ Adlai Stevenson
QUOTE-->If one took no chances, one would not fly at all. Safety lies in the judgment of the chances one takes. That judgment, in turn, must rest upon one’s outlook on life. Any coward can sit in his home and criticize a pilot for flying into a mountain in fog. But I would rather, by far, die on a mountainside than in bed. ~ Charles Lindbergh
QUOTE-->An age is called Dark not because the light fails to shine, but because people refuse to see it. ~ James A. Michener
QUOTE-->There is a spirit and a need and a man at the beginning of every great human advance. Every one of these must be right for that particular moment of history, or nothing happens. ~ Coretta Scott King
QUOTE-->Hello. My name is Iñigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. ~ Mandy Patinkin as "Iñigo Montoya" in The Princess Bride
QUOTE-->Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. ~ C.S. Lewis
QUOTE-->A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. ~ William Blake
QUOTE-->Put every great teacher together in a room, and they'd agree about everything; put their disciples in there and they'd argue about everything. ~ Bruce Lee
QUOTE-->If I were to be given the opportunity to present a gift to the next generation, it would be the ability for each individual to learn to laugh at himself. ~ Charles M. Schulz
QUOTE-->Only by not forgetting the past can we be the master of the future. ~ Ba Jin
QUOTE-->There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. ~ Charles Darwin
QUOTE-->As good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye. ~ John Milton in Areopagitica
QUOTE-->O may I join the choir invisible of those immortal dead who live again in minds made better by their presence; live in pulses stirred to generosity, in deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn for miserable aims that end with self, in thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars, and with their mild persistence urge men's search to vaster issues. ~ George Eliot
QUOTE-->We must believe in free will — we have no choice. ~ Isaac Bashevis Singer
QUOTE-->The truth isn't always beauty, but the hunger for it is. ~ Nadine Gordimer
QUOTE-->In a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. ~ Abraham Lincoln
QUOTE-->We’re all puppets, Laurie. I’m just a puppet who can see the strings. ~ Alan Moore in Watchmen
QUOTE-->It seems to me that any sensible person must see that violence does not change the world and if it does, then only temporarily. ~ Martin Scorsese
QUOTE-->From each as they choose, to each as they are chosen. ~ Robert Nozick
QUOTE-->There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty. ~ John Adams
QUOTE-->All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. ~ Muhammad
QUOTE-->Life is an error-making and an error-correcting process, and nature in marking man's papers will grade him for wisdom as measured both by survival and by the quality of life of those who survive. ~ Jonas Salk
QUOTE-->It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat. ~ Theodore Roosevelt
QUOTE-->I know that it will hurt, I know that it will break your heart, the way things are, and the way they've been. Don't spread the discontent, don't spread the lies, don't make the same mistakes with your own life. ~ Natalie Merchant
QUOTE-->Few men during their lifetime come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them. There are deep wells of strength that are never used. ~ Richard E. Byrd
QUOTE-->The world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those who feel. ~ Horace Walpole
QUOTE-->Reality is always greater — much greater — than what we know, than whatever we can say about it. ~ Michael Crichton
QUOTE-->I am 100 percent in favor of the intelligent use of drugs, and 1,000 percent against the thoughtless use of them, whether caffeine or LSD. And drugs are not central to my life. ~ Timothy Leary
QUOTE-->Genius is one per cent inspiration, ninety-nine per cent perspiration. ~ Thomas Alva Edison
QUOTE-->I think for it to be unhip to be idealistic is weird, you know? I mean, even all the best rebels to me had some sense of hope in them. ~ Tom Petty
QUOTE-->Traditionalists are pessimists about the future and optimists about the past. ~ Lewis Mumford
QUOTE-->We take the position that there is no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation. ~ Pierre Trudeau
QUOTE-->Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and your power are needed. Always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El — they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. ~ Marlon Brando as "Jor-El" in Superman: The Movie
QUOTE-->We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. ~ Oscar Wilde
QUOTE-->Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker — he, however, is the creator. Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses — and not herds or believers either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh — those who grave new values on new tables. ~ Friedrich Nietzsche
QUOTE-->love is the every only god ~ e. e. cummings
QUOTE-->Forgive us the breach of positive commands and negative commands, whether or not they involve an act, whether or not they are known to us. ~ Liturgy for Yom Kippur
QUOTE-->Tragedy blows through your life like a tornado, uprooting everything, creating chaos. You wait for the dust to settle, and then you choose. You can live in the wreckage and pretend it's still the mansion you remember. Or you can crawl from the rubble and slowly rebuild. ~ Kristen Bell, as "Veronica Mars"
QUOTE-->You always fall when you’re training, that’s sort of part of the process. If you’re not falling, you’re not training hard enough. ~ Michelle Trachtenberg
QUOTE-->The truth is that there is only one terminal dignity — love. And the story of a love is not important — what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity. ~ Helen Hayes
QUOTE-->I think the ultimate sense of security will be when we come to recognize that we are all part of one human race. Our primary allegiance is to the human race and not to one particular color or border. ~ Mohamed ElBaradei
QUOTE-->Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you've always known. ~ Frank Herbert in Dune
QUOTE-->The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth. ~ Niels Bohr

SPREE-->I’m shaking just like I’ve never seen the light.
SPREE-->I’m swimming all around in confusion.
SPREE-->I’m too good to be by myself again.
SPREE-->I’ve got eyes that see a life that’s good for me.

SPREE-->Never any doubt in me.
SPREE-->No more walking today.

SPREE-->Now it’s time to go back where you started.
SPREE-->One day he’ll get his just reward.

SPREE-->Proving once again that seasons change, so do we.
SPREE-->Put your head into the game.
SPREE-->Reach for the bright side.
SPREE-->Running through a built in maze.
SPREE-->She makes my head spin around.
SPREE-->Slinging all those words around, drives my smile right to the ground.
SPREE-->Some silly way life begins to change.
SPREE-->Some things are touched.
SPREE-->Somehow I feel what flies seem to breathe.
SPREE-->Somehow the look seems to fall off your face.
SPREE-->Soon you find your own way.
SPREE-->Soon you’ll be okay.
SPREE-->Spacing through time just like I knew I should.
SPREE-->Stick with things that will make them proud.
SPREE-->Stop and try to catch my breath, while I’m looking for my next step.

SPREE-->The people around me have all spoken.
SPREE-->The power that you receive destroys you.
SPREE-->The Sky is the limit when the ocean is hiding.
SPREE-->The sky's the limit.
SPREE-->The trees are getting harder to climb.
SPREE-->The world they licked is the world they left behind.
SPREE-->There is a place where time stands still.
SPREE-->There something about the way we feel.
SPREE-->There’s something cruel about my world.
SPREE-->There's something to touchin'.
SPREE-->These little tiny men crawl on me.
SPREE-->They cool themselves from the aim of the sun.
SPREE-->This I know, I waited a long time ago.
SPREE-->This is me, your glue guns dream.
SPREE-->Tired hard to make it, until making it got worse.
SPREE-->Today is just a day, like any other day.
SPREE-->Too far gone for people to ever change your mind.
SPREE-->Twice as good as Mars, and Mars is out of sight.
SPREE-->Voices cry out for the plea of self worth.
SPREE-->Voices ring out for the day has begun.
SPREE-->We can be free if you want to.
SPREE-->We live by the sun.
SPREE-->We will not ask why.
SPREE-->Welcome to the swimming pool.
SPREE-->Well I know, and I need, I feel were going higher and higher.
SPREE-->What makes a man feel small?
SPREE-->When love gets inside of you, it makes me invincible.
SPREE-->Whether or not, its you and me.

SPREE-->Why you wanna watch me?
SPREE-->Wonder plays a magic game.
SPREE-->Wonder who’s finding all this a game.
SPREE-->Wondering jets inside of me.

SPREE-->You can be what you want, it’s a matter of time.
SPREE-->You can feed your mouth a plan.
SPREE-->You can’t deny all the people that love you.
SPREE-->You can’t rely on a stranger to love you.
SPREE-->You find that you’re missing what others thought you had all the time.
SPREE-->You know how it goes.
SPREE-->You know the one.
SPREE-->You like what you’re given.
SPREE-->You make me good, but you make me crazy.
SPREE-->You never will come down.
SPREE-->You never will fall down.
SPREE-->You owe superworld.
SPREE-->You sigh at the rainbow that’s coming from the other side.
