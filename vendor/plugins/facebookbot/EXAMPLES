== Primo Examples!

So you want to create your own FacebookBot, eh? Good plan, sir or madam!
I have included three example bots for you, in order of difficulty
here they are: basic_bot.rb, example_bot.rb, complex_bot.rb.
== A solid example to get you started

Here's a solid example to get you started:

  require 'facebook_bot/facebook_bot'
  fb = FacebookBot.new({:email => 'ilove@you.edu', :password => 'imfat'})
  fb.set_status 'I loves facebookbot!'

That's all there is to it, folks! Isn't that easy? Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

== Basic Bot

You can take a gander at basic_bot.rb to see how a bot could login to your
Facebook profile and update your status.  Its basically the code I just 
shared with you above, plus some comments and lines and such.

== Example Bot

This bot does a little bit more, but not too much. We didn't want to
overwhelm you with parenthesis and clauses and such.. yet.  All this
bot does is login to your profile, pokes one of your friends at random,
and changes your status to a random phrase. Then it just goes to sleep
for 15 to 30 minutes, and perks right back up and starts the whole
process over again. It is all pretty simple and easy to follow. I hope.
You can ignore all that jibberish about OPTIONS and ARGV and debugging
and such.

== Complex Bot

Ut oh, you're in for a treat with here, big guy or big girl! This is a very
complicated bot that does all sorts of crazy things. better yet, I am
constantly updating it to do more crazy nonsense! You can look at this for
some great examples of how to do a certain thing. I wouldn't actually
run this for your own account, however, lest ye be asking for trouble!
Well, I am asking for trouble.. which is why I run it on my Facebook
profile. Yee-haw!

== Still Confused?
Hark! C'mon fair child! Can you not try things out on your own for once?
You need to pick up the reins and just go for it! Go for the gold! Gusto!
